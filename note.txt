6. What is the CSS Box model and what are its elements?

and left.

• Border: It is represented by lines around the content and can have several styles and
colors.

   the text to be wrapped around it. It does not change the property of the elements 
   used before it.

8. What is the purpose of the z-index and how is it used ?

=> The z-index is used to specify the stack order of positioned elements that may 
   overlap one another. Its default value is zero and can have a positive or 
   negative number.

=> A higher z index represents that the element will be stacked above than a lower z-Index.

1. Auto: Sets the stack order equal to its parents.
2. Number: Orders the stack order.
3. Initial: is used to set a CSS property to its default value.
4. Inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.


9. Explain the difference between visibility: hidden and display: none ?

=> visibility: hidden is used to hide the element, but it affects the layout of the document
   because it occupies space.

=> display: none is also used to hide the element, but it will not affect the layout 
   of the document but doesn’t occupy space.

10. What are the different media types supported by CSS? (not mandodary)

=> Including screen, there are four types of @media properties:

  • screen – for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones, etc

11. What are the different units used in CSS?

=> 
#1 Em : Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means two times the size of
the current font)✅

#2 Ex : Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)

#3 Ch : Relative to the width of the “0” (zero)

#4 Rem : Relative to font-size of the root element (html)✅

#5 Vw : Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*✅

#6 Vh :  Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*✅

#7 Vmin : Relative to 1% of viewport’s* smaller dimension✅

#8 Vmax : Relative to 1% of viewport’s* larger dimension✅

#9 % :  Relative to the parent element✅

#10 CM :  Centimetres

#11 MM :  Millimetres

#12 IN : inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)✅

#13 PX : pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)✅

16. Explain what elements will match each of the following CSS selectors?

#1. div, p - Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements

#2. div p - Selects all <p> elements that are anywhere inside a <div> element

#3. div > p - Selects all <p> elements where the immediate parent is a <div> element

#4. div + p - Selects all <p> elements that are placed immediately after a <div> element

#5. div ~ p - Selects all <p> elements that are anywhere preceded by a <div> element

17. What is Responsive Web design?

=> Responsive Web design is the method in which design and development can reply to the

19. what is difference betweeen flexbox and grid ?

=> flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid 
   was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.

20. What is the CSS position property?

=> The CSS position property defines the position of an element in a document.This 
   property works with the left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties to 
   determine the final position of an element on a page.

   Static : This is the default value for elements. The element is positioned according 
   to the normal flow of the document. The left, right, top, bottom and z-index 
   properties do not affect an element with position: static.

   Relative : Elements with position: relative remain in the normal flow of the document.
   But, unlike static elements, the left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties 
   affect the position of the element. here we can use that one.

   Absolute : Elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to their parent
   elements. In this case, the element is removed from the normal document flow.The 
   other elements will behave as if that element is not in the document. No spaces
   is created for the element in the  page layout. The values of left, top, bottom
   and right determine the final position of the element.

   One thing to note is that an element with position: absolute is positioned relative
   to its closest positioned ancestor. That means that the parent element has to have 
   a position value other than position: static.

   Fixed : Fixed position elements are similar to absolutely positioned elements. They are
   also removed from the normal flow of the document
   One thing to note is that fixed elements are not affected by scrolling. They always 
   stay in the same position on the screen.

   Sticky: position: sticky is a mix of position: relative and position: fixed. It acts
   like a relatively positioned element until a certain scroll point and then it acts 
   like a fixed element. 
   

21. What are Pseudo-classes? 

   => keyword added to a selector that specifies special state
       of that selected element
       
   => For example, it can be used to Style an element when a user mouses 
      over it Style visited and unvisited links differently Style an
      element when it gets focus

22. what is pesudo element ? 
   => used to style specific part of an element

      selector::first-letter

      h1::first-letter



23. why we set width: 100% and height: 100vh in starting container  ?

=> width: 100% 
   take entire width that available in screen to its parent element

=> height: 100vh
   100VH would represent 100% of the viewport's height, or the full height 
   of the screen

 #why we do not use width: 100vh ?

 => vw is depend on operating system browser you using
 => issue width that if we use that it will add horizontally scrolling
 => there is always some extra space there bydefault in any browser

 NOTE: here do not use vh instead use svh 
 why svh ? small viewport height
 it is also fit to mobile viewport

                  2:00
                  
24. what is use of box-sizing: border-box ?

=> The default value for box-sizing is content-box. If you set box-sizing value to 
   border-box the width of the box remains same even if you add padding, and the
   content inside the box shrink accordingly.

   it will not increase the size of element by adding padding if we use box-sizing 
   border-box

   shrink means => become smaller
